            var txt = [' Dystopian novels always seem to whisk their readers into an alternate future of humanity, with technology dominating peoples lives. Aldous Huxley’s A Brave New World fits in with this classic archetype, envisioning a future where science and technology have taken our world over so much so that people and society are manufactured to run smoothly and efficiently. Huxley does something quite fascinating, however, as he had a character named John who, instead of being brought up by a strict factory-like procedure, is brought up reading only Shakespeare\'s plays. This conditioning through science or art is all done, again, in the future. But what if you or I were brought up only reading from a single author, without being given the chance to learn the world through other’s artistic lenses? Let us do a thought experiment, comparing and contrasting how John was shaped by Shakespeare in his futuristic setting, and how I might have been different if I had only read one author’s books.', 
            '\t My choice of author is best selling author Cory Doctorow, an American born writer who actively participates in promoting anonymity. Doctorow is famous for his unique style of dystopian novels, which are set in current day times drawn in a way that readers don\'t think of it as a separate timeline, but closer to their own. Because of his style, Doctorow can get points across quickly and efficiently to convince readers of problems in our world. Now you know my only artistic lens, we can begin.'];
